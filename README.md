 Password Guessing Game â€“ Project Overview
This Python-based terminal game is a word guessing challenge where players try to unveil a secret word within a set number of attempts. The player selects from three difficulty levelsâ€”Easy, Medium, and Hardâ€”each with progressively complex words and varying limits for attempts and hints.

The game provides:
-Real-time hint feedback using Wordle-style letter comparisons
-Hint system to reveal letters one by one (limited use)
-Time tracking to measure how long the player took
-Scoring system based on difficulty and number of attempts
-At the end of the game, players can see their score, time taken, and choose to replay.

ðŸ§  Programming Language
-Python 3
Chosen for its simplicity, readability, and rich built-in librariesâ€”perfect for scripting interactive terminal games.
